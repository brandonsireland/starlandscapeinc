I did so because I was told that I couldn't be hired for a regular job until I turned 16 and a year is a long time to wait when you're 15. I liked being outside. I liked working with clients and a talented labor force. I liked creating a landscape look and maintaining that look. It wasn’t prestigious but I always had a tan. After more than 45 years of building and growing the company, gaining knowledge and expertise, I like what we do now more than ever.",
